This is a final year thesis for my bachelor's degree in Electrical & Electronic Engineering. I have received an award and also i have published my thesis at the conference UPEC2020.
The abstract can be read below and attached it's also the published paper.

Abstractâ€”
Silicone rubber insulators have been favoured over conventional insulators to be adopted on high-voltage power systems due to their hydrophobic properties and better performance in polluted environments. However, dry-bands and discharges can still be initiated on the polluted surfaces of polymeric insulators causing surface degradation and lifetime reduction. This paper presents a new procedure that identifies and assesses the location and frequency of electrical stresses such as discharges and partial arcs on high-voltage insulator surface, by analyzing visual recordings. The procedure is based on image analysis and deep learning techniques to be fully automatic and to minimize user intervention. Also, a MATLAB GUI was developed to provide fast and user-friendly control of all steps of the analysis and its results.
